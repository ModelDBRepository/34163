This simulation reproduces the model published 
in:

Cai Y, Baxter DA, Crow T
Computational Study of Enhanced Excitability in Hermissenda:
Membrane Conductances Modulated by 5-HT
Journal of Computational Neuroscience 15, 105-121, 2003

Example use:

Start SNNAP (double click on the SNNAP.jar file)
click on "Run Simulation"
Then in the new window "File"->"Load Simulation"
browse to and load bph_mixmod.smu file to load a simulation
that creates a figure similar to Fig6C from the paper and click "Start"
See http://snnap.uth.tmc.edu/ to download SNNAP
